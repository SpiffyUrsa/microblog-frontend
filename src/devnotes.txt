Outline



Redux Store Components
- dispatch: PostForm (add and edit), 
- select: TitleList, PostDetails

Store Object Structure
{
  posts: {
    id: {
      title, description, body, comments: [#1,#2,...]
    },
    id2: {post#2},...
  }
}

Questions
1. why NewPost->PostForm desiggn? pro/con vs customizable PostForm
  - the less a form knows, the probably better; they don't dispatch actions
  - the form is an UI construct, takes typed stuff and asks someone else to do it
2. why PostList doesn't deconstruct further into PostComment?
  - "Who owns the idea of _____?"
  ! - generally start with a list and a card, versus a list that simply displays
  - what parts are wrapped up together that may need to be used elsewhere by itself
Overall: be mindful of where the logic goes; don't overload with switchiness''

Notes for self
- why don't use destructure obj more often?
  - popular for react
- review mutating more
  ! - copy the entire thing up front so you don't
- add cmd+click to vsc shortcuts 
- design consideration: this could be a more useful component if the component can just take a list of posts to display
- idea of a component's 'real name' based on actual feature vs given name
- return { ...state, posts: postCopy }; // saves 10+h potentially; without ...state, this works for you until it doesn't (coded defensively)
- library: deepfreeze
- in an object, the key doesn't need "" to be converted to a string, but watch out when you have a variable named the same thing
//Google when have time: redux combineReducer

// if actionCreators.js gets too big:
// actions/
// inside that folder, a post called post.js, auth.js
// comment: if redux stuff is left at the top, often left at top level w/o folder


Code Review Q's
1. where should actions.js live, other redux stuff too?
